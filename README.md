This repository contains a Linear Programming (LP) model to optimize pension fund management for Armco Incorporated. 

The financial manager responsible for ensuring that the pension fund meets future cash obligations through strategic bond investments.The goal is to minimize the initial allocation of funds while ensuring all future pension payments are covered. The model incorporates three bond options with different prices, coupon structures, and maturity dates, as well as a fixed-rate account for excess cash.

This project demonstrates how mathematical optimization techniques can be applied in financial planning to balance risk, return, and liquidity constraints efficiently.
